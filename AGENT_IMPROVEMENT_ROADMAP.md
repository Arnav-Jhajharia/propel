# 🛠️ LangGraph Agent - Improvement Roadmap

## Current Status

The agent **works** but has some areas for improvement when all phases are enabled.

---

## 🎯 Improvements Needed (Assuming All Phases Enabled)

### 1. **State Persistence** ✅ DONE
- ✅ Added to `/api/lead-agent` endpoint
- ✅ Loads state before processing
- ✅ Saves state after response
- ✅ Works in demo chat now

### 2. **Property Detection Flow** 🔧 NEEDS WORK

**Current Issue:**
When user shares URL like: "I'm interested in this viewing: https://..."
- Should: Detect URL → Add property → Start screening
- Actually: Goes to "respond" → Returns generic response

**Fix Needed:**
```typescript
// In router, detect URL earlier in priority
if (hasUrl && !state.propertyId) {
  return Command({ goto: "detect_property" });
}
```

### 3. **Screening Flow** 🔧 NEEDS WORK

**Current Issue:**
- Screening starts too late
- Should start immediately after property is detected

**Fix Needed:**
After property is detected, automatically transition to screening if not complete

### 4. **Follow-up Phase** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**What's Missing:**
- Follow-up node exists but never triggered
- Need time-based job/cron to trigger follow-ups
- Or trigger on certain events (no response in 24h)

**Implementation Plan:**
- Add cron job to check for stale conversations
- Trigger follow-up messages automatically
- Track follow-up count to avoid spam

### 5. **Property Q&A Context** 🔧 NEEDS WORK

**Current Issue:**
- Q&A works but could be smarter
- Should proactively offer information after detection

**Improvement:**
After detecting property, say: "I've loaded the property! It's a 2BR, 850sqft condo for $2000/month. What would you like to know?"

### 6. **Viewing Booking Intelligence** 🔧 NEEDS WORK

**Current Issue:**
- Only offers viewing if user explicitly asks
- Should offer proactively after Q&A

**Improvement:**
After answering 2-3 questions, proactively offer: "Would you like to schedule a viewing?"

### 7. **Error Handling** ✅ IMPROVED
- ✅ Added logging to `leadReply`
- ✅ Added logging to API endpoint
- ✅ Now we can debug issues

---

## 🔍 Debugging Current "Happy to help" Issue

The bot is returning "Happy to help." which means `leadReply()` is failing.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **OpenAI API Key missing/invalid** ← Most likely
2. **Rate limit hit**
3. **Network error**
4. **Malformed context JSON**

**Check:**
```bash
# In terminal, look for:
[leadReply] Error: [error details]
```

**Quick Fix:**
Ensure `.env.local` has:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## 🚀 Recommended Improvement Order

### Phase 1: Fix Current Issues (Priority)
1. ✅ Fix OpenAI API key issue
2. ✅ Verify property detection works
3. ✅ Ensure screening starts properly

### Phase 2: Enhance Flow (Important)
4. Make property detection trigger screening automatically
5. Add proactive property info after detection
6. Add proactive viewing offer after Q&A

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Nice-to-have)
7. Implement follow-up automation
8. Add smart context awareness
9. Add conversation summarization

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Check Terminal Logs** - See what error is happening
2. **Verify OpenAI API Key** - Ensure it's set correctly
3. **Test Each Phase Individually** - Isolate which phase is failing
4. **Fix Routing Logic** - Ensure proper phase transitions
